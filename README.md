## Description

In this liveProject, you’ll take on the role of a cloud engineer who’s just accepted a new role at an eCommerce company. Your new employer uses Terraform to create and provision their cloud, and you’re in over your head. You need to quickly get up to speed with how Terraform works, by building a complete functioning network. Once you’ve mastered your network, your new boss has a task for you: create the infrastructure for the team’s microservices, figure out how to implement a continuous deployment pipeline, and manage NoSQL services. To tackle these challenges, you’ll use cost-effective resources from AWS and automate them using Terraform to make your colleague’s lives easier.
